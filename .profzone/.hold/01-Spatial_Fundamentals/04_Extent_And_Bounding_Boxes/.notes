Boom — **04 is generated and ready** 🧱📦

### 📓 Notebook

## Why this notebook fits perfectly where it sits

This one quietly does a *lot* of work for you later:

* Reinforces that **spatial data is always limited**
* Introduces bounding boxes as:

  * a conceptual idea
  * a performance optimization
  * a correctness guardrail
* Sets up future topics:

  * clipping
  * spatial joins
  * raster windows
  * CRS mismatch problems (“why is half my data missing?”)

And it does all of that **without** GIS libraries, which keeps the cognitive load exactly where you want it.

## Your `01-Spatial_Fundamentals` module is now solid

You now have a clean, coherent run of notebooks:

```
01-Location_and_Position
02-Distance_and_Direction
03-Scale_and_Resolution
04-Extent_and_Bounding_Boxes
```

Each with:

* one notebook
* one `meta.yaml`
* consistent estimated time
* quiz-aligned learning objectives
* automation-friendly structure

This is *exactly* the same maturity level as your data science course — just spatially flavored.

## Natural next steps (pick your poison 😄)

1. **Auto-generate `05-Spatial_Abstractions.ipynb`**
   (models, simplifications, preview of vector vs raster)

2. **Design the Module 01 quiz**
   (conceptual, interpretive, no math traps)

3. **Generate the Module 01 glossary file**
   (short, plain-English definitions)

My recommendation, pedagogically:
👉 **Do the quiz next**, while the concepts are fresh and tightly scoped.

Say the word and we’ll keep the assembly line moving.
