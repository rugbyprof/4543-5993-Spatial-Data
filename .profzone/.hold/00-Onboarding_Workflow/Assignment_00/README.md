# 📡 Assignment 00

## Communication & Workflow Setup (Read This or Suffer Later)

> **This assignment is boring on purpose.**
> If we don’t get communication and workflow right _now_, everything else in the course becomes harder than it needs to be.

This assignment ensures that:

- You can **reach me**
- I can **find your work**
- You can **submit assignments**
- We don’t waste time debugging email, usernames, or missing repos

This is the foundation. Skip it, and the rest of the semester is pain.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Join and properly configure **Slack**
- Understand **how communication works** in this course
- Create and organize a **GitHub repository**
- Submit correct information so I can automate grading

---

# PART 1 — Slack (This Comes First)

### Why Slack?

Because email is slow, messy, and terrible for technical courses.

Slack is:

- Where questions get answered
- Where clarifications happen
- Where help appears _outside of class time_

If you’re not on Slack, you’re functionally not in the course.

---

## ✅ Slack Setup Checklist

1. Join the course Slack workspace:
   👉 **[https://griffin-courses.slack.com](https://griffin-courses.slack.com)**

2. Make sure:
   - You are added to the **correct class channel**
   - You appear in the **class roster**

3. **Update your Slack profile image**
   - This must be a **photo of you**
   - Not an avatar
   - Not a cartoon
   - Not your dog
   - Not a letter
   - I need to recognize you in real life

(Yes, this matters. It helps me learn names faster.)

## 🧠 How Slack Is Used in This Course

- **Public channels**
  Use these for:
  - Assignment clarification
  - “What did you mean by…?”
  - Errors others might also hit

- **Direct messages**
  Use these for:
  - Personal issues
  - Grade questions
  - Things you don’t want public

I respond on Slack far more reliably than email.
Some days fast. Some days slower. But Slack is always better than email.

### 🚫 Important Rule

**Do not email me** unless I explicitly ask you to.

Emails get buried. Slack doesn’t.

---

## 📱 Strong Recommendation (Not Optional in Practice)

Install Slack on:

- Your computer
- Your phone

I often post:

- Fixes
- Clarifications
- Code hints
- “Don’t do this” warnings

Students who monitor Slack **consistently do better**. This is not theoretical — I’ve watched it happen for years.

---

# PART 2 — GitHub (Your Submission Pipeline)

Now that we can communicate, we need a place for your work to live.

All assignments in this course are submitted through **GitHub**.

---

## ✅ GitHub Setup Checklist

1. Create a GitHub account (if you don’t already have one)

2. Choose a **username** you will remember

3. Create a **new repository** with a name that starts with the course number, for example:

   ```
   4543-Spatial-Data-and-Mapping
   ```

4. **Check the box**:
   ✅ _“Add a README.md file”_

This is not optional.

---

## 📝 Your Main README.md (Very Important)

Edit the root `README.md` file in your repo and include:

- Your **first and last name**
- Your **email address**
- A **photo of you** (same rules as Slack)
- The course name

This README is how I verify:

- I’m in the right repo
- It belongs to you
- You did not submit someone else’s work

If I can’t identify you quickly, grading slows down.

---

## 📁 Required Repo Structure (Start Now)

Inside your repo, create this folder:

```
Assignments/
```

Inside `Assignments/`, create a `README.md` that contains a table like this:

```markdown
## Assignments

|  #  | Folder Link | Assignment Description         |
| :-: | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
|  0  | A00         | Communication & Workflow Setup |
```

Yes, it looks pointless now.
It will not look pointless later.

This table becomes your **assignment index** for the entire semester.

---

## 🧠 Two Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

1. **Your GitHub username ≠ your repository name**
   I need the repo link, not your profile page.

2. **Broken links break grading scripts**
   If I can’t click it and see your work, it’s as if it doesn’t exist.

---

# 📤 What to Submit (Single Form)

You will complete a short **Communication Setup Form** that asks for:

- Your name
- Your Slack display name
- Your GitHub username
- A **direct link** to your course repository

⚠️ Fill this out carefully.
I use this data to automate grading.
Incorrect info causes very avoidable problems.

---

## 🧭 Why This Assignment Exists

This assignment prevents:

- “I didn’t see that message”
- “You graded the wrong repo”
- “I thought email was fine”
- “My username is different everywhere”

Think of this as:

> **Setting your GPS before you start driving**

---

## ✅ Grading

This assignment is **completion-based**.

If:

- You’re on Slack
- Your profile is correct
- Your GitHub repo exists
- Your info is accurate

You get full credit.

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

Slack me:

- What step you’re on
- What you tried
- What went wrong

That’s how engineers ask for help.

---

### 🎉 Once This Is Done

You are officially:

- Connected
- Trackable
- Ready to code

Next up:
**Assignment 01 — Workflow Setup & Hello World (Spatial Edition)**

And yes — it _will_ feel easier after this.

---

If you want, next we can:

- Turn this into a **one-page PDF**
- Create a **student checklist version**
- Align Assignment 01’s README with this structure

Just say the word.
