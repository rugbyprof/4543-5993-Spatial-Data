# ✅ Assignment 01 — Student Checklist

## Workflow Setup & Hello World (Spatial Edition)

> **If every box below is checked, you are done.**
> If something is unchecked, that’s exactly where you’re stuck.

---

## 🔹 PART 1 — Software Installed

- [ ] Docker Desktop is installed
- [ ] Docker Desktop is **running**
- [ ] I can run this command without errors:

  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

- [ ] Jupyter Lab is available to me via:
  - [ ] Docker (recommended), **or**
  - [ ] Local install (acceptable for this assignment)

---

## 🔹 PART 2 — Assignment Files

- [ ] I downloaded or cloned the Assignment 01 folder
- [ ] My folder structure looks like this:

```
Assignment_01_Workflow/
├── data/
│   └── geo_terms.json
├── notebooks/
│   └── workflow_check.ipynb
└── README.md
```

- [ ] I did **not** rename folders
- [ ] I did **not** move files around

---

## 🔹 PART 3 — Jupyter Is Running

- [ ] Jupyter Lab opens in my browser
- [ ] I can see the `notebooks/` folder
- [ ] I opened `workflow_check.ipynb`
- [ ] I can run a code cell (Shift + Enter)

---

## 🔹 PART 4 — Code Runs Successfully

Inside `workflow_check.ipynb`:

- [ ] Python version prints without error
- [ ] The JSON file loads successfully
- [ ] The list of geo terms prints to remind me this is data, not magic
- [ ] No red error messages appear

If you see red text, **stop and fix that first**.

---

## 🔹 PART 5 — File Paths Check (Very Common Issue)

- [ ] The notebook opens the file using:

  ```python
  ../data/geo_terms.json
  ```

- [ ] I did **not** hard-code an absolute path
- [ ] I understand that relative paths matter

---

## 🔹 PART 6 — Submission Ready

- [ ] My notebook runs **top to bottom without errors**
- [ ] I saved the notebook after running all cells
- [ ] I uploaded the correct `.ipynb` file (or screenshot if instructed)

---

## 🔹 FINAL SELF-CHECK

- [ ] I could explain what this assignment was _actually testing_
- [ ] I did not email the instructor
- [ ] I am ready for Assignment 02

If all boxes are checked → **you’re done** 🎉

---

## 🆘 If You’re Stuck

Before asking for help, identify **which checkbox you can’t check**.

When posting on Slack, say:

> “Assignment 01 — stuck on Part X, Item Y.”

That one sentence speeds things up dramatically.

---

## 🧠 Mental Model Reminder (Read This Twice)

- Docker = environment
- Jupyter = interface
- Notebook = artifact you submit
- Errors = information, not failure

If something breaks, that’s **normal** — it’s part of learning how tools actually behave.
