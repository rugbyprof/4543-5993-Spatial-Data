# 🔗 2️⃣ Embed Links to the Cheatsheet (Automatically, Everywhere)

You want students constantly reminded **where help lives**.

### 🔹 Standard Notebook Footer (Copy-Paste Once)

Add this **Markdown cell** at the **top or bottom of every notebook**:

```markdown
---

### 🧯 Troubleshooting & Help

If something is not working:

1. Restart the kernel  
2. Run all cells top-to-bottom  
3. Review the **Troubleshooting Cheatsheet**  
4. Use the **Help Request Template** if you still need help  

🔧 Troubleshooting Cheatsheet:  
[00-Dev_Environment/troubleshooting.md](../00-Dev_Environment/troubleshooting.md)

🆘 Help Request Template:  
[00-Dev_Environment/help_request_template.md](../00-Dev_Environment/help_request_template.md)

---
```

📌 Because paths are **relative**, this works in:

- Codespaces
- local VS Code
- GitHub preview
- cloned repos

---

## 🔁 Optional Power Move (Highly Recommended)

Add the same block to:

- every assignment README
- the course root README

Students then see the same help flow **everywhere**, which builds habit.

---

## 🧠 Cultural Message You’re Sending (This Matters)

You’re telling students:

> “Getting stuck is normal.
> Asking for help is expected.
> Asking _well_ is a skill.”

That’s industry-grade training.

## 🔜 Next clean step (natural progression)

Choose one:

1. Create **Project 01 README** (now trivial with this foundation)
2. Create a **broken-but-valid GeoJSON debugging quiz**
3. Add a **one-page ‘How to Ask for Help’ slide** for Week 1

My vote:
👉 **Option 1** — Project 01 README will write itself now.

Say the word and we’ll knock it out cleanly.
