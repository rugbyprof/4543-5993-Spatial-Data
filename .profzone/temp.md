## 5. Working on Assignments

- Always open notebooks from **your repo**, not the instructor’s.
- When you finish:
  1. Save in Colab.
  2. Check changes are synced to GitHub.
  3. Move the notebook from `Assignments/` → `Completed/`.

I will tell you how to show completed work on D2L later.

## ✅ Quick Recap

- Create your **GitHub repo**.
- Copy over **Assignments/**.
- Use **CodeSpaces (GitHub tab)** to edit.

## Discovery

I discovered that if you replace the `Assignments` folder name with `Completed` it will save that working copy in your completed folder. Remember capitalization matters and spelling matters. Not sure what will happen if you get the path (folder name really) wrong.
