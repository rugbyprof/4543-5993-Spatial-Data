# Introspective Questions — Raw Spatial Data

## Location & Reference

- Why does location require a reference to be meaningful?
- How could two people describe the same location differently?
- What assumptions are hidden when a coordinate pair is recorded?

## Coordinates & Meaning

- What information is missing from an (x, y) coordinate pair?
- Why can swapping longitude and latitude cause extreme errors?
- Why do coordinate ranges differ for latitude and longitude?

## Distance & Movement

- Why might straight-line distance be misleading in real-world scenarios?
- Which distance better models walking on a campus, and why?
- When does distance stop being a purely mathematical concept?

## Paths & Decisions

- Why is a path more than just a list of points?
- What assumptions are made when measuring distance along a path?
- How does movement introduce uncertainty into spatial data?

## Extent & Inclusion

- What does a bounding box decide for you automatically?
- Why might important data fall outside a chosen extent?
- How can changing an extent change the story a map tells?

## Validation & Trust

- Why should spatial data be validated visually before analysis?
- When can visualization be misleading instead of helpful?
- Why is “the map looks right” not a sufficient test?

## Abstraction & Reality

- Why is a point not the same as the object it represents?
- What details are lost when real places are abstracted into geometry?
- When is spatial abstraction useful, and when is it dangerous?

## Transfer Thinking

- How might assumptions that work on a campus fail at a global scale?
- Why do spatial problems often appear correct before they fail?
- What makes spatial data fundamentally different from non-spatial data?
