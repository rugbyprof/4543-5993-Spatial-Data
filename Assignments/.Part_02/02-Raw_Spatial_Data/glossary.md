# Glossary — Raw Spatial Data

**Spatial Data**  
Data that describes the location, shape, or extent of something in space.

**Feature**  
A single spatial entity consisting of geometry and associated properties.

**Geometry**  
The spatial component of a feature (point, line, or polygon).

**Point**  
A single coordinate pair representing a location, not a physical object.

**LineString**  
An ordered list of coordinate pairs representing a path or movement.

**Polygon**  
A closed sequence of coordinate pairs representing an area.

**Bounding Box (Extent)**  
A rectangular boundary that defines what area is included or excluded.

**Coordinate**  
A numeric value describing position relative to a reference system.

**Longitude**  
The east–west coordinate, typically ranging from −180 to 180 degrees.

**Latitude**  
The north–south coordinate, typically ranging from −90 to 90 degrees.

**Reference System**  
An agreed-upon framework that gives coordinates meaning.

**Distance**  
A measurement whose meaning depends on scale, direction, and assumptions.

**Euclidean Distance**  
Straight-line distance assuming flat, unconstrained space.

**Path-Based Distance**  
Distance measured along a sequence of connected segments.

**Validation**  
The process of checking data structure and meaning before analysis.

**Visualization**  
A visual representation used to explore or verify data, not to prove correctness.
