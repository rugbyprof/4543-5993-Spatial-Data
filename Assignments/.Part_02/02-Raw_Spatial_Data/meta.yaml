title: Raw Spatial Data
course: Spatial Data & Mapping
part: Part_02
type: project
graded: true
estimated_time: 2.5–3 weeks

prerequisites:
  - 01-Hello_GeoJSON
  - Part_01 Python Onramp

description: >
  This project introduces students to raw spatial data through
  direct inspection, editing, and validation of spatial files.
  Emphasis is placed on structure, assumptions, and spatial reasoning
  rather than GIS software or advanced analysis.

learning_outcomes:
  - Read and validate raw spatial data formats
  - Identify points, paths, and spatial extents
  - Explain why spatial data requires reference and context
  - Recognize when distance, location, or extent assumptions fail
  - Use visualization as a validation tool, not a source of truth

deliverables:
  - Completed notebooks (01a–01f)
  - GitHub repository or submission folder
  - Reflection responses embedded in notebooks

notes:
  - This project intentionally avoids projections and CRS theory
  - Approximate reasoning is acceptable and encouraged
  - Formal spatial analysis is introduced in later projects
