title: Scale, Resolution, and Detail
part: Part_02
module: Raw_Spatial_Data
sequence: 3

type: lesson
format: notebook

estimated_time: 75-90 minutes

prerequisites:
  - 02A-When_Coordinates_Arent_Enough
  - 02B-Distance_Depends_on_Assumptions

learning_objectives:
  - Explain the difference between scale, resolution, and detail
  - Describe how scale affects what spatial data can represent
  - Explain why detail changes as scale changes
  - Identify when simplification improves clarity
  - Recognize common failure modes caused by scale misuse
  - Reason about spatial data fitness for purpose

key_concepts:
  - scale
  - resolution
  - detail
  - abstraction
  - generalization
  - extent
  - bounding box
  - spatial context

skills_applied:
  - interpreting coordinate-based data
  - reasoning about spatial abstraction
  - identifying modeling assumptions
  - connecting data representation to purpose
  - critical spatial thinking

deliverables:
  - Completed notebook.ipynb
  - Written responses to reflection prompts

assessment:
  formative:
    - in-notebook reflection questions
    - conceptual reasoning prompts
  summative:
    - quiz questions derived from reflection and failure modes

  instructor_notes: .profinfo.md
  background:
    - background_notes/overview.md
    - background_notes/glossary.md

policies:
  collaboration: discussion allowed, work must be individual
  ai_usage: permitted for explanation and debugging, not for direct answers
  late_work: see course syllabus

notes:
  - This lesson intentionally avoids projections and CRS
  - Focus is on conceptual understanding, not tooling
  - Designed to normalize simplification and abstraction

title: Editing and Simplifying Spatial Data
part: Part_02
module: Raw_Spatial_Data
sequence: 4

type: lesson
format: notebook

estimated_time: 75-90 minutes

prerequisites:
  - 02A-When_Coordinates_Arent_Enough
  - 02B-Distance_Depends_on_Assumptions

learning_objectives:
  - Explain why raw spatial data is rarely usable as-is
  - Describe simplification as a form of abstraction
  - Identify risks when editing points, lines, and polygons
  - Recognize common spatial editing failure modes
  - Explain why visual validation is essential
  - Articulate ethical considerations when editing spatial data

key_concepts:
  - spatial editing
  - simplification
  - abstraction
  - generalization
  - visual validation
  - geometry integrity
  - modeling intent

skills_applied:
  - reasoning about data modification
  - identifying spatial data risks
  - validating data visually
  - connecting edits to purpose and scale
  - critical evaluation of spatial representations

deliverables:
  - Completed notebook.ipynb
  - Written responses to reflection prompts
  - Corrected spatial data artifacts (when applicable)

assessment:
  formative:
    - in-notebook reflection questions
    - visual inspection prompts
  summative:
    - quiz questions derived from failure modes and ethics
    - conceptual explanations of editing decisions

policies:
  collaboration: discussion allowed, submitted work must be individual
  ai_usage: permitted for explanation and debugging, not for direct answers
  late_work: see course syllabus

notes:
  - Emphasizes intentional editing over blind modification
  - Focuses on conceptual understanding before tooling
  - Reinforces responsibility and ethics in spatial data handling
