# .profinfo — 02C: Scale, Resolution, and Detail

## Role in the Course

02C explains **why spatial data changes as you zoom, simplify, or summarize**, and why that change is **intentional**, not a failure.

If:

- 02A established _meaning_ (coordinates need context)
- 02B established _assumptions_ (distance depends on rules)

Then:

- 02C establishes _tradeoffs_ (detail is sacrificed on purpose)

This lesson prepares students to stop asking “Why did this break?” and start asking “What scale am I working at?”

---

## Big Idea (Anchor)

Scale determines what details are visible, relevant, or meaningful.

Zooming out does not just shrink things — it **removes information**.

---

## Learning Intent (Instructor-Facing)

Students should leave this lesson able to:

- explain why spatial data looks different at different scales
- distinguish scale from zoom
- understand resolution as a choice, not a flaw
- recognize when detail becomes noise
- articulate why one dataset cannot answer all spatial questions

---

## 0️⃣ Framing the Problem — “Why Did My Data Change?”

Student frustration to name explicitly:

- features disappearing
- paths simplifying
- maps “losing accuracy”

Core message:

> The data didn’t break — the scale changed.

Goal:
Normalize data change as expected behavior.

---

## 1️⃣ Scale Is About Context, Not Zoom

Core idea:
Scale describes the relationship between representation and reality, not screen size.

Concepts:

- large-scale vs small-scale (counterintuitive)
- scale as abstraction level
- zoom ≠ scale

Guiding prompts:

- Why can a campus map show sidewalks but a world map cannot?
- What questions does each scale answer well?

Guardrail:
No ratios, no math, no projections.

---

## 2️⃣ Resolution Controls Detail

Core idea:
Resolution determines how much information is preserved.

Concepts:

- granularity
- intentional loss of detail
- resolution as design choice

Key insight:
Resolution is not about correctness — it’s about usefulness.

Prompts:

- When does less detail improve clarity?
- When does high resolution become a liability?

---

## 3️⃣ Detail Is Purpose-Dependent

Core idea:
Detail only matters relative to the question being asked.

Examples:

- campus navigation vs regional planning
- GPS tracks vs commute summaries

Target realization:
“This detail isn’t wrong — it’s wrong for this task.”

---

## 4️⃣ Simplification Is Not Lying

Core idea:
Simplification is communication, not deception.

Concepts:

- generalization
- abstraction
- clarity vs precision

Key message:
A simplified map can be more honest than a detailed one if the purpose is clear.

Prompts:

- When does simplification help?
- When does it mislead?

---

## 5️⃣ Extents and Bounding Boxes

Core idea:
What you include determines what you see.

Concepts:

- extent as focus
- bounding box as attention filter
- visibility vs existence

Common student failure:
“Nothing is showing.”

Reframe:
The data is out of view, not missing.

---

## 6️⃣ Failure Modes Caused by Scale

Common issues:

- using small-scale data for large-scale questions
- over-interpreting simplified geometry
- assuming missing detail equals missing data
- confusing performance limits with design choices

Exam seeds:

- Why is the wrong scale more dangerous than a calculation error?
- How can scale produce believable but incorrect conclusions?

---

## 7️⃣ Introspective Pause — Thinking Spatially

Reflection prompts:

- Why does scale change meaning?
- When is less detail more honest?
- How do scale and resolution interact?
- Why is there no single “correct” map?

These prompts intentionally reappear later in exams and projects.

---

## Backward / Forward Connections

Backward:

- Builds on coordinate meaning (02A)
- Builds on modeling assumptions (02B)

Forward:

- Editing and simplification (02D)
- Visualization and cartography
- Projections and CRS (later, begrudgingly)

---

## Scope Guardrails

This lesson explicitly avoids:

- projections
- CRS
- map scale math
- GIS software
- raster analysis

Focus is on **thinking before tooling**.

---

## Success Criteria (Instructor Check)

If students say:

- “That explains why things disappear”
- “I shouldn’t expect one dataset to do everything”
- “Detail depends on purpose”

Then the lesson worked.
