# 02C — Scale, Resolution, and Detail

## Big Idea

**Scale determines what details are visible, meaningful, or even possible.**

When spatial data changes as you zoom, simplify, or summarize, that change is not a bug — it is a consequence of scale and resolution.

This lesson explains _why_.

---

## Why This Lesson Exists

Up to now, you have learned that:

- coordinates need context
- distance depends on assumptions

In this lesson, you will see that:

> **Data representation always involves tradeoffs.**

There is no single “correct” level of detail for spatial data — only levels that are _appropriate for a purpose_.

---

## What You’ll Learn

By completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- explain the difference between **scale**, **resolution**, and **detail**
- describe how scale changes what spatial data can represent
- explain why features disappear or simplify at different scales
- recognize when simplification improves clarity
- identify common mistakes caused by using data at the wrong scale

This lesson focuses on **thinking**, not tools.

---

## What You’ll Do

In the notebook, you will:

- reason about spatial scale using simple coordinate examples
- compare representations of the same data at different levels of detail
- explore how resolution affects interpretation
- analyze bounding boxes and extents conceptually
- answer reflection questions designed to prepare you for quizzes and exams

You will **not** be asked to:

- calculate map scale ratios
- work with projections or CRS
- use GIS software

That comes later.

## How to Work Through This Lesson

1. Read this README completely
2. Open `notebook.ipynb`
3. Work through the notebook **top to bottom**
4. Run code cells and modify them when prompted
5. Answer reflection questions in your own words
6. Commit and push your completed notebook

Take your time — this lesson is about understanding, not speed.

## Common Pitfalls (Read This)

- ❌ Assuming more detail is always better
- ❌ Expecting one dataset to answer all questions
- ❌ Thinking missing detail means missing data
- ❌ Confusing zoom level with scale

If something looks “wrong,” ask:

> _Is this the wrong scale for my question?_

---

## A Thought to Carry Forward

> **There is no single true map — only representations chosen for a purpose.**

Understanding that idea now will make later topics feel logical instead of frustrating.

## Need Help?

Before asking for help:

- re-run the notebook from the top
- read the relevant section in `background_notes/`
- check that you understand the reflection prompts

When asking for help, include:

- what you expected to happen
- what actually happened
- which part of the notebook you’re on
