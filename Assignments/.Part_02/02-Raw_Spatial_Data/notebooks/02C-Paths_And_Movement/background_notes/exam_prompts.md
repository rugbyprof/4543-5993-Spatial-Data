# Exam Prompts — Scale, Resolution, and Detail

## Short Answer

- Explain the difference between scale and resolution.
- Why does spatial detail change as scale changes?

## Conceptual

- Why is zooming not the same as changing scale?
- Why is higher resolution not always better?

## Scenario-Based

- A dataset looks “wrong” after zooming out. Explain why this may happen.
- Why would a small-scale map be inappropriate for navigation tasks?

## Reflection

- When is less detail more honest than more detail?
- Why is there no single “correct” spatial representation?

## Common Misconceptions

- “Missing detail means missing data”
- “Zooming changes scale”
- “More detail always improves accuracy”
