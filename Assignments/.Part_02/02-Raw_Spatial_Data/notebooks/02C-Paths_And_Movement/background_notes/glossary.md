# Glossary — Scale, Resolution, and Detail

**Scale**  
The relationship between a spatial representation and the real-world area it represents.

**Large-Scale**  
Represents a small area with high detail.

**Small-Scale**  
Represents a large area with low detail.

**Resolution**  
The level of detail preserved in a spatial representation.

**Detail**  
The amount of information included about spatial features.

**Simplification**  
The intentional reduction of detail to improve clarity or performance.

**Abstraction**  
The process of representing complex reality using simplified models.

**Extent**  
The spatial area covered by a dataset or view.

**Bounding Box**  
A rectangular region that defines the limits of a spatial area.

**Generalization**  
The process of reducing complexity while retaining essential structure.
