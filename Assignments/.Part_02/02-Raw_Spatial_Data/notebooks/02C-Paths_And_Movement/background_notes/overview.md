# Overview — Scale, Resolution, and Detail

Spatial data does not represent reality at all levels equally.

As scale changes, so do:

- the amount of detail preserved
- the questions that can be answered
- the interpretations that make sense

This lesson explains why spatial data often appears to “change” when zoomed, filtered, or summarized — and why that change is intentional.

## Scale vs Zoom

Scale describes the **relationship between a representation and the real world**, not how large something appears on a screen.

- Large-scale data represents small areas with high detail
- Small-scale data represents large areas with low detail

Zooming does not change scale — it only changes _what you are looking at_.

---

## Resolution and Detail

Resolution controls how much information is preserved.

- Higher resolution keeps more detail
- Lower resolution simplifies representation

Resolution is a **choice**, not a measure of accuracy.

---

## Why This Matters

Using data at the wrong scale can:

- hide important patterns
- exaggerate minor features
- produce misleading conclusions

Understanding scale and resolution helps ensure that spatial data is **fit for its intended purpose**.

## Key Takeaway

> There is no single correct representation of spatial data — only representations chosen for specific questions.
