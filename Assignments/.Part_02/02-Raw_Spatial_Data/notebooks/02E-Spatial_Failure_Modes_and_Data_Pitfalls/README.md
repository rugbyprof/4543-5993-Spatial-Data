# 02E — Spatial Failure Modes & Data Pitfalls

## Big Idea

**Spatial data can be wrong without appearing broken.**

This lesson teaches you how spatial errors occur quietly — and how to recognize them.

---

## What You’ll Learn

By completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- identify common spatial failure modes
- explain why spatial errors are often silent
- recognize plausible but incorrect outputs
- apply skepticism to spatial results

---

## What You’ll Do

In this lesson, you will:

- examine common spatial error patterns
- reason about why errors go unnoticed
- analyze scenarios involving misleading outputs
- reflect on validation strategies

## Checklist

- [ ] You can define a silent spatial failure
- [ ] You can explain why errors go unnoticed
- [ ] You can describe validation strategies

## A Thought to Carry Forward

> **If a spatial result looks reasonable, that’s when you should be most cautious.**
