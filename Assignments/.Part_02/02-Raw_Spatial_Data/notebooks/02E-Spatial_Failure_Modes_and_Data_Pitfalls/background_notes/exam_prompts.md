# Exam Prompts — Spatial Failure Modes & Data Pitfalls

## Short Answer

- What is a silent failure in spatial data?
- Why are spatial errors often hard to detect?

## Conceptual

- Explain why a map can look correct but still be wrong.
- Why are believable errors more dangerous than visible ones?

## Scenario-Based

- A dataset plots in the ocean but contains valid numbers. Explain possible causes.
- Two datasets align visually but represent different scales. What could go wrong?

## Reflection

- Why should spatial outputs always be questioned?
- What validation steps reduce spatial error risk?

## Common Misconceptions

- “If it plots, it’s correct”
- “Valid numbers imply valid locations”
- “Maps reveal errors automatically”
