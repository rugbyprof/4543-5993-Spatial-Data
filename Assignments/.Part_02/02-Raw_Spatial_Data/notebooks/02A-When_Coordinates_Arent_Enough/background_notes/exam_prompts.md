# Exam Prompts — When Coordinates Aren’t Enough

## Short Answer

- Why are coordinates alone insufficient to describe location?
- What information is missing from an (x, y) pair?

## Conceptual

- Explain why location requires a reference system.
- Why can two people describe the same location differently?

## Scenario-Based

- A dataset plots correctly but appears in the wrong country. Explain possible causes.
- A point uses valid numeric values but represents no real location. How is this possible?

## Reflection

- Why are coordinate-related errors often difficult to detect?
- Why is a believable wrong location more dangerous than a visible error?

## Common Misconceptions

- “Coordinates are locations”
- “Latitude and longitude are self-explanatory”
- “If numbers are valid, the location must be correct”
