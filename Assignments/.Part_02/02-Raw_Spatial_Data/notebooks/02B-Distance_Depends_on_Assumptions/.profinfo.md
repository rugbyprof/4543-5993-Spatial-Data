Absolutely — here is the **same level of concrete, drop-in mapping** for
**02b — Distance Depends on Assumptions**, written so you can **paste these directly as code-cell prompts** into the notebook _and_ mirror them in your progressive-outline markdown.

This continues the philosophy:

> **No new Python. New thinking.**

# 🔗 Mapping Part_01 → 02b Code Cells

**Notebook:** `02b-Distance_Depends_on_Assumptions.ipynb`

**Big Idea:**
Distance is not a formula — it’s a **model of movement**.

---

## 🧩 Section 0 — Framing the Problem

_(Minimal code — conceptual setup)_

### Student Prompt (markdown only)

- Why does “distance” feel obvious?
- When might straight-line distance be misleading?

This primes them for _why_ multiple distance models exist.

---

## 🧩 Section 1 — Straight-Line Distance Is an Assumption

### 🟢 Source:

`Part_01/01-Working_with_Data_Basic/03-Data_Types_and_Arithmetic.ipynb`
`Part_01/04-Foundations/08-timing_and_performance.ipynb` (lightly)

---

### 📌 Code Cell 1.1 — Euclidean Distance (Planar)

**Skill reused:** arithmetic, variables

**Prompt:**

> Compute straight-line distance between two points.

```python
x1, y1 = 0, 0
x2, y2 = 3, 4

dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1

distance = (dx**2 + dy**2) ** 0.5
print(distance)
```

**Instructor intent:**
Students recognize this immediately — _then you destabilize it later_.

---

### 📌 Code Cell 1.2 — Why This “Works”

**Skill reused:** print, explanation

**Prompt (no new code):**

- What assumptions are being made about space?
- What does this distance ignore?

---

## 🧩 Section 2 — Path-Based Distance (Movement Matters)

### 🟢 Source:

`Part_01/03-Loops_and_Iteration/01-For_Loops.ipynb`
`Part_01/03-Loops_and_Iteration/03-File_Loops_and_With.ipynb`

---

### 📌 Code Cell 2.1 — Distance Along a Path

**Skill reused:** loops, indexing, accumulation

**Prompt:**

> Compute total distance along a path defined by multiple points.

```python
path = [
    (0, 0),
    (3, 0),
    (3, 4)
]

total = 0

for i in range(len(path) - 1):
    x1, y1 = path[i]
    x2, y2 = path[i + 1]

    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    segment = (dx**2 + dy**2) ** 0.5
    total += segment

print("Path distance:", total)
```

**Hidden lesson:**
Same start and end. Very different answers.

---

### 📌 Code Cell 2.2 — Compare Distances

**Skill reused:** variables, comparison

```python
straight = ((3**2 + 4**2) ** 0.5)
print("Straight-line:", straight)
print("Path-based:", total)
```

**Concept reinforced:**
Distance depends on _how movement is allowed_.

---

## 🧩 Section 3 — Manhattan Distance (Grid Thinking)

### 🟢 Source:

`Part_01/02-Scalar_Types_and_Control_Flow/02-Control_Flow.ipynb`

---

### 📌 Code Cell 3.1 — Manhattan Distance

**Skill reused:** arithmetic, abs()

**Prompt:**

> Compute Manhattan distance between two points.

```python
x1, y1 = 0, 0
x2, y2 = 3, 4

manhattan = abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1)
print(manhattan)
```

**Instructor intent:**
Introduce a _different model_ without new math.

---

### 📌 Code Cell 3.2 — Which Distance Fits Which World?

**Skill reused:** conditionals

```python
mode = "campus"

if mode == "campus":
    print("Manhattan distance may be more realistic.")
else:
    print("Straight-line distance may be sufficient.")
```

**Key takeaway:**
Choosing a distance model is a **design decision**.

---

## 🧩 Section 4 — Degrees Are Not Distance

### 🟢 Source:

`Part_01/05-Working_with_Data_Adv/03-loading_and_exploring_data.ipynb`

---

### 📌 Code Cell 4.1 — Degrees vs Miles (Approximation)

**Skill reused:** arithmetic, constants

**Prompt:**

> Approximate how far one degree of latitude and longitude represent.

```python
miles_per_degree_lat = 69
miles_per_degree_lon = 54  # approximate, mid-latitudes

print("Latitude:", miles_per_degree_lat)
print("Longitude:", miles_per_degree_lon)
```

**Important framing:**
This is _approximation_, not precision.

---

### 📌 Code Cell 4.2 — Why This Breaks Down

**Skill reused:** print, reasoning

**Prompt (markdown):**

- Why does longitude distance change with latitude?
- Why is this “good enough” sometimes — and dangerous other times?

---

## 🧩 Section 5 — Distance Models Encode Assumptions

### 🟢 Source:

`Part_01/02-Scalar_Types_and_Control_Flow/02-Control_Flow.ipynb`

---

### 📌 Code Cell 5.1 — Choosing a Distance Model

**Skill reused:** functions, conditionals

```python
def distance(p1, p2, model="straight"):
    x1, y1 = p1
    x2, y2 = p2

    if model == "straight":
        return ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5
    elif model == "manhattan":
        return abs(x2-x1) + abs(y2-y1)
```

**Instructor intent:**
Make assumptions explicit — not hidden.

---

## 🧩 Section 6 — Failure Modes in Distance

### 🟢 Source:

`Part_01/06-Describing_and_Visualizing_Data/02-Summary_Statistics.ipynb`

---

### 📌 Code Cell 6.1 — Same Data, Different Answers

**Skill reused:** comparison, printing

```python
p1 = (0, 0)
p2 = (3, 4)

print("Straight:", distance(p1, p2, "straight"))
print("Manhattan:", distance(p1, p2, "manhattan"))
```

**Key lesson:**
Both are “correct”. Context decides usefulness.

---

## 🧩 Section 7 — Introspective Pause (No Code)

### Exam-Ready Prompts

- Why do Euclidean and Manhattan distances differ?
- Which distance model best represents walking on a campus?
- When is straight-line distance misleading?
- Why is choosing a distance model a design decision?

These map directly to:

- quizzes
- short answers
- scenario questions

---

## 🧠 Why this mapping works

- Students reuse:
  - loops
  - arithmetic
  - conditionals
  - functions

- No libraries
- No GIS jargon
- Distance becomes **a modeling choice**, not a formula hunt

By the end of 02b, students should think:

> “Distance isn’t wrong — my assumptions were.”

---

## 🔜 Natural next step

From here, the progression is clean and intuitive:

👉 **02c — Scale, Resolution, and Detail**
(why distance and shape change as you zoom out)

OR

👉 Generate:

- `02b-Distance_Depends_on_Assumptions.md`
- `meta.yaml` for 02b
- quiz question bank for 02b

You’re building something _very_ solid here — and it shows.
