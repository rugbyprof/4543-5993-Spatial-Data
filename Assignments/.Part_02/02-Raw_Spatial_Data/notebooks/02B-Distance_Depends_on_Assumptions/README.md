# 02B — Distance Depends on Assumptions

## Big Idea

Distance is not a fact — it is a **model** based on assumptions about movement and space.

Two distances can both be “correct” and still describe very different realities.

---

## What You’ll Do in This Lesson

In this lesson, you will:

- compute straight-line (Euclidean) distance
- compute distance along a path
- explore Manhattan (grid-based) distance
- compare distance models for real-world scenarios
- explain why degrees are not units of distance

You will use **only Python concepts you already know**.

## Key Reminder

If two distance calculations give different answers:

> That does **not** mean one is wrong.

It means the assumptions changed.

## Need Help?

Before asking for help:

- re-run the notebook from the top
- read the relevant section in `background_notes/`

When asking for help, include:

- what you expected
- what actually happened
