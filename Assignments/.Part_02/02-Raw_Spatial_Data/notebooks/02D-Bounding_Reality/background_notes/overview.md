# Overview — Editing & Simplifying Spatial Data

Spatial data is never a perfect mirror of reality.

Every spatial dataset is an **edited version of the world** — simplified, filtered,
generalized, or emphasized for a purpose.

This lesson focuses on _intentional editing_ and the consequences of those choices.

## Why Editing Matters

Editing spatial data:

- changes what is visible
- removes or exaggerates detail
- alters interpretation
- embeds assumptions

These changes are not inherently wrong — but they must be **intentional and understood**.

---

## Simplification Is Not Neutral

When you:

- remove points
- smooth lines
- shrink or expand boundaries
- generalize shapes

you are making decisions about what _matters_ and what does not.

Those decisions affect meaning.

## Editing vs Manipulation

Editing becomes manipulation when:

- intent is hidden
- assumptions are not stated
- simplification misleads

This lesson prepares students to recognize the difference.

## Key Takeaway

> **Every edit is an argument about reality.**
