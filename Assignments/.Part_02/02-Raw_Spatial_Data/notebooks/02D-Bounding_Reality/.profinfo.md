Got it 👍 — **outline only**, no files, no notebook, no YAML yet.
Here is the **progressive outline for 02D**, written in the same voice and rigor as 02A–02C and meant to live first as `.profinfo.md`.

# 🧠 Progressive Outline

## **02D — Editing & Simplifying Spatial Data**

### Role in the course

This lesson is where students stop treating spatial data as _precious artifacts_ and start treating it as **editable, intentional representations**.

If:

- 02A taught _meaning_
- 02B taught _assumptions_
- 02C taught _tradeoffs_

Then **02D teaches agency**.

Students learn that **they are allowed to change the data** — carefully.

---

## 🧩 Big Idea (Anchor)

> **Editing spatial data is not cheating — it is modeling.**

Simplification, generalization, and editing are _design decisions_, not mistakes.

---

## 🎯 Learning Intent (Instructor-Level)

By the end of this lesson, students should:

- feel comfortable modifying raw spatial data
- understand why simplification exists
- recognize when edits improve clarity
- articulate the risks of careless editing
- see spatial data as _constructed_, not sacred

---

## 0️⃣ Framing the Problem — _“Why Can’t I Just Leave the Data Alone?”_

### Core Setup

Students often assume:

- raw data is “correct”
- editing introduces error
- modification is dishonest

This section challenges that belief.

### Key Message

> Raw spatial data is rarely usable _as-is_.

### Instructor Note

Name the fear:

- “I don’t want to break it”
- “What if I ruin the data?”
- “Who am I to change this?”

Normalize intentional change.

---

## 1️⃣ Raw Data Is Not Neutral

### Core Idea

All spatial data is already edited _before_ you see it.

### Concepts Introduced

- selection
- omission
- generalization (without math)
- design bias

### Conceptual Prompts

- Who decided what to include?
- Who decided what to leave out?
- What problem was this data originally meant to solve?

---

## 2️⃣ Simplification as Abstraction

### Core Idea

Simplification reduces complexity to emphasize meaning.

### Examples

- fewer vertices in a line
- fewer points in a path
- broader shapes instead of exact outlines

### Key Insight

> Simplification trades precision for clarity.

### Conceptual Prompts

- When does simplification help?
- When does it hurt?
- What detail matters _for this task_?

---

## 3️⃣ Editing Points, Lines, and Polygons

### Core Idea

Each geometry type has **different editing risks**.

### Geometry-Specific Thinking

- **Points**
  - relocation
  - deletion
  - aggregation

- **Lines**
  - vertex removal
  - path smoothing
  - segment reduction

- **Polygons**
  - boundary simplification
  - closure rules
  - topology awareness (light, no jargon)

### Student Realization (Target)

> “Editing geometry changes meaning differently depending on the feature type.”

---

## 4️⃣ What Can Go Wrong (And Why It Matters)

### Common Editing Failures

- breaking polygon closure
- reversing coordinate order
- collapsing shapes unintentionally
- over-simplifying until meaning is lost

### Key Message

> Most spatial errors are **quiet**, not dramatic.

### Exam-Ready Prompts

- Why are spatial editing errors hard to detect?
- Why is visual validation important?

---

## 5️⃣ Visual Validation as a Skill

### Core Idea

Spatial edits must be _seen_, not just trusted.

### Concepts

- visual inspection
- sanity checking
- comparing before/after representations

### Tie-in

This naturally reinforces:

- geojson.io
- simple plotting
- bounding boxes and extents

---

## 6️⃣ Ethics of Editing Spatial Data

### Core Idea

Editing implies responsibility.

### Topics (light, conceptual)

- misleading simplification
- hiding inconvenient detail
- honesty vs clarity
- audience awareness

### Reflection Prompts

- When does editing become deception?
- Who is harmed by oversimplified maps?

---

## 7️⃣ Introspective Pause — _Editing With Intent_

### Reflection Questions

- Why is raw data rarely sufficient?
- How does editing relate to modeling?
- What responsibility comes with editing spatial data?
- How does simplification connect to scale and resolution?

These are **excellent exam seeds**.

---

## 🔗 Backward & Forward Connections

### Backward

- Builds directly on:
  - scale & resolution (02C)
  - bounding boxes
  - abstraction

### Forward

Prepares students for:

- data cleaning
- spatial joins
- cartography
- projections (eventually… reluctantly 😄)

---

## 🚧 Scope Guardrails

This lesson does **NOT**:

- implement advanced geometry algorithms
- introduce GIS software
- rely on spatial libraries
- require math-heavy simplification

This is **thinking before tooling**.

---

## 🧠 Instructor Confidence Check

If students finish 02D and say:

- “Editing isn’t wrong if it’s intentional”
- “I need to validate changes visually”
- “Simplification changes meaning”

Then the lesson did its job.

---

## ✅ Status

- Progressive outline: **DONE**
- Ready for:
  - `meta.yaml`
  - `README.md`
  - `notebook.ipynb`
  - broken/fixable GeoJSON mini-labs

---

### When you’re ready

Next step by the standard you set:

👉 **Generate `meta.yaml` for 02D**

Say **go** when ready.

# =================================================

# =================================================

YES. 🙌
**Standards are now locked.** This is how courses survive multiple semesters without entropy.

As requested, here is the **progressive outline FIRST** for:

> **02C — Scale, Resolution, and Detail**

This is written to become your hidden `.profinfo.md` _and_ the conceptual backbone for:

- `background_notes/`
- `README.md`
- `notebook.ipynb`

No code yet. No files generated. Just **structure + intent**.

---

# 🧠 Progressive Outline

## **02C — Scale, Resolution, and Detail**

### Role in the course

This lesson explains **why spatial data changes as you zoom, filter, or summarize**, and why that change is **not a bug**.

If 02A taught _meaning_ and 02B taught _assumptions_,
02C teaches _tradeoffs_.

---

## 🧩 Big Idea (Anchor)

> **Scale determines what details are visible, relevant, or meaningful.**

Zooming out doesn’t just shrink things — it **removes information**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Intent (Instructor-Level)

By the end of this lesson, students should:

- stop expecting one “correct” representation of spatial data
- understand why features disappear or simplify
- recognize resolution as a _choice_, not a limitation
- explain why small-scale maps cannot answer large-scale questions

---

## 0️⃣ Framing the Problem — _Why Did My Data Change?_

### Core Setup

Students have already seen:

- points disappear
- paths simplify
- bounding boxes feel “wrong”
- maps lose detail when zoomed out

This section names the frustration.

### Key Message

> The data didn’t break.
> You changed the scale.

### Instructor Note

This is where you normalize:

- “Why did my point vanish?”
- “Why did this shape change?”
- “Why does this look worse?”

---

## 1️⃣ Scale Is About _Context_, Not Zoom

### Core Idea

Scale describes the **relationship between data and reality**, not how big it looks on screen.

### Concepts Introduced

- large-scale vs small-scale (counterintuitive!)
- map scale as abstraction level
- why zoom ≠ scale

### Conceptual Prompts

- Why is a campus map “large-scale”?
- Why is a world map “small-scale”?
- What questions does each scale answer well?

### Guardrail

🚫 No cartographic math
🚫 No ratios
🚫 No projection talk

This is **mental model first**.

---

## 2️⃣ Resolution Controls Detail

### Core Idea

Resolution determines **how much detail you keep**.

### Concepts

- resolution as granularity
- fewer points = less detail
- resolution as intentional loss

### Key Insight

> Resolution is not about accuracy — it’s about **what you choose to preserve**.

### Conceptual Prompts

- Why would you _want_ less detail?
- When does high resolution become a problem?
- How does resolution affect performance and clarity?

---

## 3️⃣ Detail Is Context-Dependent

### Core Idea

Detail is only meaningful **relative to scale and purpose**.

### Examples

- campus sidewalks vs city roads
- building outlines vs country borders
- GPS tracks vs commute summaries

### Student Realization (Target)

> “This detail isn’t wrong — it’s just wrong _for this scale_.”

### Exam-Ready Prompts

- Why does too much detail reduce clarity?
- When is simplification beneficial?

---

## 4️⃣ Simplification Is Not Lying

### Core Idea

Removing detail is not deception — it’s communication.

### Concepts

- generalization
- abstraction
- simplification as design

### Key Message

> A simplified map can be more truthful than a detailed one — depending on purpose.

### Conceptual Prompts

- When does simplification improve understanding?
- When does it become misleading?
- Who decides?

---

## 5️⃣ Bounding Boxes, Extents, and Focus

### Core Idea

What you include determines what you see.

### Concepts

- extents as attention
- bounding boxes as filters
- focus vs completeness

### Student Pain Point (Named)

> “Why does my data look empty?”

Answer:

> You’re looking at the wrong extent.

### Conceptual Prompts

- Why does changing extent change interpretation?
- How do extents hide and reveal patterns?

---

## 6️⃣ Failure Modes: When Scale Misleads

### Common Failures

- using small-scale data for large-scale questions
- over-interpreting simplified features
- assuming missing detail means missing data
- confusing performance limits with design choices

### Exam-Ready Prompts

- How can scale cause incorrect conclusions?
- Why can zooming out distort interpretation?

---

## 7️⃣ Introspective Pause — _Thinking Like a Spatial Designer_

### Reflection Prompts

- How does scale affect what questions you can answer?
- When is less detail more honest?
- How do resolution and scale interact?
- Why is “one true map” a myth?

These are **gold-tier exam questions**.

---

## 🔗 Backward & Forward Connections

### Backward

- Builds on:
  - coordinate meaning (02A)
  - distance assumptions (02B)

### Forward

Prepares students for:

- spatial abstraction
- feature generalization
- projections (later, begrudgingly 😄)
- visualization and cartography

---

## 🚧 Scope Guardrails (Very Important)

This lesson does **NOT**:

- introduce raster math
- compute scale ratios
- teach projections
- talk about CRS
- use GIS software

This is **thinking about data**, not tooling.

---

## 🧠 Instructor Confidence Check

If students finish 02C and say:

- “That explains why things disappear”
- “I get why one dataset can’t answer everything”
- “I shouldn’t expect detail at every scale”

Then the lesson succeeded.

---

## ✅ Status

- Progressive outline: **DONE**
- Ready to become:
  - `.profinfo.md`
  - `background_notes/overview.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `notebook.ipynb`

---

### Next step (per the standard you just set)

👉 **Generate `meta.yaml` for 02C**
Then:
👉 README → then notebook

Say _go_ and we continue exactly the same way.

# ====================================================================

# 02D — Editing & Simplifying Spatial Data

## Big Idea

**Editing spatial data is not cheating — it is modeling.**

Raw spatial data is rarely ready to use as-is.  
Editing, simplifying, and generalizing data are _intentional design decisions_ that shape meaning.

This lesson is about learning **when and how to edit responsibly**.

---

## Why This Lesson Exists

Many students believe:

- raw data is always “correct”
- editing introduces errors
- changing geometry is dishonest

In reality:

> Every spatial dataset you’ve ever used has already been edited.

This lesson helps you understand **why editing exists**, **what can go wrong**, and **how to do it with intent**.

---

## What You’ll Learn

By completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- explain why raw spatial data is rarely neutral
- describe simplification as a form of abstraction
- identify editing risks for points, lines, and polygons
- recognize common spatial editing failure modes
- explain why visual validation is essential
- discuss ethical considerations when editing spatial data

This lesson focuses on **thinking**, not software tools.

---

## What You’ll Do

In the notebook, you will:

- reason about why spatial data is edited
- explore simplification and abstraction conceptually
- analyze editing risks for different geometry types
- examine examples of “quiet” spatial errors
- validate edits through visual inspection
- reflect on ethical responsibilities in spatial modeling

You will **not** be asked to:

- perform complex geometry algorithms
- use GIS software
- rely on advanced spatial libraries

That comes later.

## Common Pitfalls (Read This)

- ❌ Assuming raw data is neutral
- ❌ Editing without understanding consequences
- ❌ Trusting edits without visual inspection
- ❌ Over-simplifying until meaning is lost

If something feels “off,” ask:

> _What did this edit change — and why?_

---

## A Thought to Carry Forward

> **Editing spatial data always changes meaning.  
> The question is whether that change is intentional and honest.**

Understanding this now will make future spatial analysis far more reliable.

---

## Need Help?

Before asking for help:

- re-read the reflection prompts
- compare before/after examples carefully
- think about _intent_ rather than correctness

When asking for help, include:
